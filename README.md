## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What do companies look for when hiring a candidate?
2. What did survey participants Regard as an important factor when choosing a company to work for?
3. Compensation and benefits other than base salary that are important to respondents?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook that details my thought process when looking at the factors. Also there is dataset needed used when doing the survey

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://omeradelez.medium.com/job-hunting-expectations-8ed1180d407d). Or going throught the notebook for more details.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
